# SharePreferences

Simple SharePreferences example app designed to show how to pass a data from a secondary activity back to the main activity launcher activity. In this case, the user is inputting 2 strings (a first and last name), a spinner value, and some numerical numbers then saving to show on the main launcher activity.
